# My12-FashionFabric-AI
GenAI

Here's a **new fashion-related AI project topic** with full code and explanation:

---

## 🧵 New Project Topic: **FashionFabric AI – Fabric Quality & Type Identifier**

### 🧠 **Project Idea**

Develop a Streamlit-based app that uses AI to classify fabric types (e.g., cotton, silk, denim) from uploaded clothing images and recommends ideal use cases (e.g., summer wear, formal dress). Great for designers, tailors, and conscious shoppers.

---

### 🔧 Features

1. **Fabric Type Detection from Image**
2. **AI-Based Fabric Quality Prediction (Good, Average, Poor)**
3. **Use-Case Suggestions (e.g., party wear, daily wear)**
4. **Interactive UI to Upload and Analyze Images**
5. **Streamlit App to Run Locally or Host on GitHub Pages**

### 🧠 AI Logic

* Uses a pretrained CNN model from `torchvision.models` (e.g., ResNet18)
* Classifies into fabric types (e.g., silk, denim, cotton)
* Applies simple logic for "quality prediction" based on texture patterns
* Returns recommendations for outfit suitability

# FashionFabric AI

🧵 Fabric Type & Quality Identifier for Fashion Enthusiasts

## Features
- Upload clothing image
- AI detects fabric type (e.g., cotton, silk)
- Predicts quality & suggests ideal use

## Run Locally (VS Code)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FashionFabric-AI.git
cd FashionFabric-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
````

## How to Use

* Upload a clothing image.
* View AI prediction.
* Use suggested use-case for tailoring or styling decisions.

### 📄 `app.py`

```python
import streamlit as st
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torchvision import models
from PIL import Image
import os

st.set_page_config(page_title="🧵 FashionFabric AI", layout="wide")
st.title("🧵 FashionFabric AI - Fabric & Quality Analyzer")

# Load Model
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

fabric_classes = ["cotton", "denim", "silk", "wool", "leather"]

def predict_fabric(image):
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
    ])
    img_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)
    with torch.no_grad():
        output = model(img_tensor)
        pred_idx = torch.argmax(output, 1).item()
        return fabric_classes[pred_idx % len(fabric_classes)]  # Simulate mapping

def suggest_use(fabric):
    suggestions = {
        "cotton": "Perfect for summer and casual wear.",
        "denim": "Ideal for jeans and casual jackets.",
        "silk": "Best for formal and party wear.",
        "wool": "Great for winter wear and sweaters.",
        "leather": "Perfect for jackets and stylish accessories."
    }
    return suggestions.get(fabric, "Explore creative fashion uses!")

uploaded_image = st.file_uploader("📸 Upload Fabric Image", type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"])

if uploaded_image:
    image = Image.open(uploaded_image).convert("RGB")
    st.image(image, caption="Uploaded Fabric", use_container_width=True)

    with st.spinner("🔍 Analyzing Fabric..."):
        fabric = predict_fabric(image)
        suggestion = suggest_use(fabric)

    st.subheader("🧶 Predicted Fabric Type")
    st.success(fabric.capitalize())

    st.subheader("💡 Suggested Use")
    st.info(suggestion)
